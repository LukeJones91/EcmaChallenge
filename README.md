# EcmaChallenge

A series of challenges in ECMA Script 2015 for @sumanita

## 1. Arrays

An initial familiarisation challenge to build up knowledge of the Git and unit-testing approach.

Given an array of ints, output an array of squares.

For example:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
[5, 2, 9] -> [25, 4, 81]
[] -> []
null -> <<throws an Error()>>
```
